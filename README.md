# 2048 Game

###### The 2048 game remake using Flutter


--- 

### 🕹️ The Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer [Gabriele Cirulli](https://gabrielecirulli.com). The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.


### 🚂 Motivation

I was fascinated by Flutter's ability to support cross platform and I wanted to implement something fun with using it. Then the thought of creating this game came up. The tiles move logic is copied from other 2048 game projects.

### ☑️ Todo
1. Stats (number of moves, time played, etc)
2. Work on the animations (there's no animation for shifting tiles along the board at the moment)
